# Park-n-Spark
This project aims to alleviate the persistent problem of parking space shortages in urban and semi-urban areas by introducing a comprehensive program designed to streamline parking reservations and payments. The innovative application enables users to secure parking spaces in advance or automatically assigns walk-in drivers to available slots, ensuring efficient use of parking facilities. By incorporating a robust payment system that tracks parking duration, accurately calculates fees, and records vehicle information, the program enhances convenience for car owners. Moreover, it contributes to reducing traffic congestion and improving urban mobility, making city life more manageable and efficient for everyone.
